AGR_ProjectileBase is the low-level class for implementing AGR Projectiles and
using them with the AGR Projectile Launcher Component.
It also extends the movement logic by using the AGR Projectile Movement Component.

Usually, what you are looking for is the AGR_Projectile class that will cover
most cases unless your implementation requires to customize the root component
of this actor. So if you choose to use this class be mindful about the required
setup explained below.

## Mandatory Setup

Ensure that you swap out the 'Component Class' in the 'ProjectileRoot' property
with a subclass of UPrimitiveComponent.

### Swap out component in C++:
- Use the ObjectInitializer of the constructor.
- See AAGR_Projectile for an example.

Swap out component in Blueprints:
- Open your child blueprint of AAGR_ProjectileBase and select the component
called ProjectileRoot.
- In the details panel, change the Component Class. Note that only C++ subclasses
are supported.
