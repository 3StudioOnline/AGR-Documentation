## Enums

### Trace Mode
`Trace Mode` enum value determines how trace points are used for performing
trace operations.

Values:
* `Raycast`: Trace along each arc segment from start to end.
* `Sweep`: Trace between the current and previous points on the segment, as if sweeping through the arc.

### Trace Shape
`Trace Shape` enum value specifies the geometric shape used during the trace operation.

Values:
* `Line`
* `Box`
* `Sphere`

### Trace Hit Mode
`Trace Hit Mode` enum value specifies whether the AGR tracer component should detect a single hit or multiple hits.

Values:
* `Single Hit`
* `Multiple Hits`

### Tracer Update Type
`Tracer Update type` enum value specifies the state transitions of an AGR tracer component during its lifecycle.

Values:
* `Registered`
* `Unregistered`
* `Started`
* `Ended`

## Structs

### Trace Params
`Trace Params` struct holds parameters for trace operations used by the AGR tracer components.

Values:
* `Trace Channel`: The trace channel to use for the trace (e.g., camera, visibility, etc.).
* `Trace Complex`: Whether to trace complex geometry (true) or simple collision shapes (false).
* `Ignore Self`: Whether to ignore the actor initiating the trace.
* `Draw Debug Type`: Type of debug visualization for the trace.
* `Draw Time`: Duration for which debug visuals should persist (in seconds).
* `Single Frame Trace Color`: Color used for single frame trace debug visuals.
* `Multi Frame Trace Color`: Color used for multi frame trace debug visuals.
* `Trace Hit Color`: Color used for debug visuals when a trace hits an actor.
