## AGR Plugin
`AGR V` Plugin is a powerful and versatile suite of components and tools
designed to streamline the development of complex gameplay mechanics in *Unreal
Engine 5*. Built on years of experience and community-driven feedback, `AGR V`
introduces advanced systems for locomotion, inventory management, and projectile
mechanics, all with a focus on multiplayer performance and scalability.
This modular toolkit is ideal for developers looking to create large-scale
multiplayer experiences, offering seamless integration with *Unreal Engineâ€™s*
existing features and simplifying the creation of immersive, responsive gameplay.

### AGR Locomotion
`AGR Locomotion` drives character rotation and aim offset with extreme precision,
ensuring smooth, jitter-free animations, even in first-person perspectives.
Designed for multiplayer environments, it leverages *Unreal Engine 5's*
thread-safe functionality and asynchronous proxy calls, minimizing multiplayer
footprint by using only replicated movement data. It supports both character and
pawn classes and integrates easily with any movement component.

### AGR Inventory
`AGR Inventory` system combines inventory and equipment management into a single,
efficient component. It features custom serialization and replication for
seamless multiplayer performance, allowing for persistent item storage and
automatic inventory updates upon player reconnection.
The system includes event dispatchers for UI updates and item logic, making it
highly customizable and easy to integrate into any project.

### AGR Projectile
`AGR Projectile` includes a projectile launcher and projectile components,
offering a robust system for spawning and managing projectiles with custom
penetration and bounce logic. It supports homing, physical material interaction,
and physics sub-stepping, ensuring realistic and performant projectile behavior
in multiplayer settings. The system is easy to set up, highly configurable, and
designed with network optimization in mind.

### AGR Function Library
An ever-growing library of utility functions designed to streamline common game
development tasks. Current features include functions for camera and cursor aim
calculations, component retrieval, angle calculations for hit reactions or
ricochets, and velocity-based rotation determination.
This library enhances development efficiency by providing ready-to-use solutions
for frequent challenges.
