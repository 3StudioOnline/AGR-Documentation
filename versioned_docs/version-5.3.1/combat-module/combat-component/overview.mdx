The `AGR Combat Component` manages combat gameplay mechanics and handles registering and triggering tracer components.

Tracer components are used to simulate and detect hits or impacts during melee attacks, arcs, or other proximity-based combat logic.

Use the `AGR Trace Anim Notify State` to control when registered tracers should start and end during animations.

## Combat Component Settings

`On Hit` is triggered when a tracer component detects a hit.

:::note
You should implement logic to filter and define what a "unique" hit means for your use case.

This component is designed to be extended and integrated with custom tracer implementations, such as sockets, arcs, or line traces.
